<h2>My Story</h2>
Running was not something this nerd always did; but in 2010 I decided to try and run a half marathon.  The Indianapolis Mini Marathon was one of 
largest and since it was close I decided that would be my one and only half marathon.  So began my journey into the world of running.  After months of 
training I managed to complete the run in two hours and twenty-one minutes.  Since then I've run 21 more half marathons and 3 full marathons.  So far
my fastest time is one hour and fifty-four minutes.
